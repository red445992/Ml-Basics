# ML-Basics üìö

Welcome to **ML-Basics**!  
This repository is dedicated to learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning by following the [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning) and building practical projects along the way.

---

## üöÄ Main Goal

- Understand core ML concepts from the ground up.
- Reinforce learning with hands-on Jupyter notebooks.
- Build and document one or two solid ML projects.

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `Tensor.ipynb` ‚Äî Introduction to Tensors and TensorFlow basics
- `sklearn.ipynb` ‚Äî Experiments and tutorials with Scikit-Learn, including datasets and models
- `Mathematics/` ‚Äî Math foundations for ML (linear algebra, probability, etc.)
- `WorkingWithNumericalData/` ‚Äî Data preprocessing and numerical data handling
- `notebooks/` ‚Äî (Additional notebooks and explorations)
- `requirements.txt` ‚Äî Core dependencies for running the notebooks

> _Note: You can explore more files and directories in the repo for extended topics and experiments._

## üìù Learning Journey & Highlights

- **Based on:** [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning)
- **TensorFlow basics:** Learn how tensors work, their types, and how to manipulate them.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Work with classic datasets (Iris, Digits), build and train models like SVM, and visualize results.
- **Mathematical Foundations:** Essential math for ML, covered in dedicated notebooks.
- **Projects:** As progress continues, one or two comprehensive ML projects will be added here with detailed documentation.
